          <h2>About Leafbarrow</h2>
          <p>The <b>Leafbarrow</b> is a revolutionary landscaping product that helps with all sorts of cleanup jobs around your yard. 
              It enables faster and larger yard cleanups for leaves, mulch, branches, grass, gravel and more. It can also be used to 
              transport heavier objects around without the need for bulky tarps or wobbly wheel barrows. The Leafbarrow has been a 
              labor of love; the result of years of engineering and product development, making it the ideal companion for anyone 
              looking to care for their yard quickly and more efficiently.</p>
           <h2>How it Works</h2>
           <p>No need to rake leaves into a pile! As you rake leaves, move the Leafbarrow directly to the spot that needs clearing 
               and rake directly into it, creating the pile inside the barrow. When you are finished and need to dump the pile, the 
               Leafbarrow lifts to an intermediate position off the ground, making it easier to move. The rear bucket can be removed 
               to easily empty the Leafbarrow out into a dump pile for composting. </p>   
           <h2>Innovative Design</h2>
           <p>The Leafbarrow is expertly designed to make your job easier:
           <ul>
             <li>Rake leaves up the <i>front ramp</i> directly from the ground into the barrow.</li>
             <li>Use the <i>levered handle</i> to bring the barrow into position for easy transportation.</li>
             <li>The <i>rear bucket</i> is removable for easy dumping.</li>
           </ul>
           </p>
